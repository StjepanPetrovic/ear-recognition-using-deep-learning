# Ear recognition using deep learning

## Database selection and preparation:
Ear images are downloaded from https://webctim.ulpgc.es/research_works/ami_ear_database/ and they are:
- resized to 128 pixels in width,
- resized images are converted to grayscale,
- normalized to have values between 0 and 1 and saved as numpy arrays.

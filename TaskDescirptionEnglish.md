# Ear recognition using deep learning

Biometric Systems course project

## Project description:
Ear recognition is a biometric modality that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Unlike facial recognition, the ear is less affected by facial expressions, changes in hairstyle or makeup, making it a reliable source of biometric identification. The aim of the project is to investigate the use of deep learning techniques for ear recognition.

## Elements:
- __Theoretical part__ 

  - Ear: Give an introduction to the topic, describe the selected biometric characteristic,vcharacteristic measures and define areas of application.
  - Ear image databases: Analyze and compare publicly available ear image databases.
  - Deep Learning: Give an introduction to deep learning, classify deep learning methods and explain their application in biometrics.
  - Analysis of deep learning methods for ear recognition: To compare the deep learning methods used in biometrics and to select and describe in more detail the method that will be used in the practical part of the work.

- __Practical part__

  - Database selection and preparation: Selecting one of the publicly available ear bases and dividing the base into a set for training and testing.
  - Image preprocessing: Noise removal and ear feature enhancement using image filtering and feature point extraction.
  - Implementation of the selected machine learning method: Implementation of some of the deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and others. The model is trained using pre-processed images of the ear on which the identity of the person is marked.
  - Performance evaluation of the chosen method: Using metrics such as False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and others. Evaluation is needed run on a separate test data set to ensure unbiased the results.
